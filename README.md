# Naive-Bayes

This is a short project for an Artificial Intelligence course at University, implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm because I liked it. This project takes an Excel file as input with training and prediction data, examples can be found in the `/data` directory, and completes it using Naive Bayes with the Laplace smoothing method to address the zero-frequency problem.
